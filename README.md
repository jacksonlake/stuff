My take on using Fully Connected Neural Network for classifying the famous IRIS flower database. Two hidden layers with ReLU function,
the last layer scales the output using Sigmoid and gives classification. MSE function was chosen as a cost function. PyTorch framework was used 
for this purely _eucational_ project.
